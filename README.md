The dataset is consist of many features from which we decide to use only 4 
In this project we create diferent py for diferent models 
For the purposes of this projects wen we use Decision tress, SVM and MLP both as classifier and regressors 
Of course we use the simple linear regression which perform the best since the problem is not very complicated 

ALL OF THIS DONE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ADVANCE DATA MINING COURSE
